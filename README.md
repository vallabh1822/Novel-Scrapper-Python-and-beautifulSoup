# Novel-Scraper-With-Python-and-beautifulSoup
Scrape a Novel from BoxNovel.com and Save it in EPUB format
Download all files in module upload them to jupyter lab,
open Box_Novel.ipynb in jupyter lab,
copy Novel name from boxnovel,
run Box_Novel.ipynb,
your Epub file will be created.

Enjoy!!

Important Note: I have used time delay (#time.sleep(random.randint(2,11))) in my program so as to not get blocked by the site you could use other methods but it is still a great way to not appear suspicious. You can decrease the time but keep average greater than 4 sec per chapter :) happy scrapping
