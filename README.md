# DOWNLOAD WEBNOVELS /CHINESE NOVEL /QIDIAN NOVEL IN EPUB FORMAT FROM BOXNOVEL.COM

download wenovel_download.exe from dist folder (click on view raw)
double-click on downloaded file
as windows doesn't allow you to run app from unknown source it will prompt a
screen click on run_anyway
-a window will open
-copy the name of novel from boxnovel and paste it
note:start chapter , end chapter and delay are all in integer so put only integer value
note: delay is maximum time to wait before downloading / scraping next chapter I did that so 
as to not overload site or get blocked by site rather than using PROXIES. As proxies which are free are unreliable. keep delay time high (5-20 sec) as not get blocked don't worry though

doing math on average it will take  n*(delay/2)  # n is number of chapters.

OR IF YOU KNOW PYTHON YOU CAN DOWNLOAD PYTHON FILES UPLOAD IT TO JUPYTER OR ANY OTHER IDE

Scrape a Novel from BoxNovel.com and Save it in EPUB format
Download all files in module upload them to jupyter lab,
open Box_Novel.ipynb in jupyter lab,
copy Novel name from boxnovel,
run Box_Novel.ipynb,
your Epub file will be created WITH HTML aswell in jupyter lab

Enjoy!!

Important Note: I have used time_delay variable (#time.sleep)) in my program so as to not get blocked by the site you could use other methods but it is still a great way to not appear suspicious. You can decrease it just by setting time_delay lesser but not zero :) happy reading.
